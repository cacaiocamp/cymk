_cymk_ is a piece for violin, violocello and live-electronics, composed and developed for [Plurisons](https://www.plurisons.com/) festival 1st edition, held in João Pessoa, Paraíba. It was premiered at Sala Radegundis Feitosa by Mariana Salles (violin), Elise Pittenger (cello) and me (Caio Campos, electronics), 28.07.2022.

The ideia of the piece is based on a question: what are the expectations for a piece composed for this instrumentation? I tried to reflect about this and use those expectations as a compositional component of the piece. For that, I used mainly _pizzicatos_, played on a restricted range of a major second and only samples, with some processing, on the electronics, triggered by different processes.
